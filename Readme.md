# Extreme low bit rate vocoder

This code is from a 2012 hackathon, and it REQUIRES  R2012a <= Matlab < R2021a for DSP Toolbox for Cepstral coefficients to LPC conversion.
Such methods are commonly known and may even be around in Octave/Python code.

Much of the code is Octave compatible.

For performance and general usability, further work should probably be in porting to Python.

`Main.m` is the only program to run.
